# Vhedia head unit

## Background / rationale

 - I use a Vhedia M-series head unit in a model year 2023 Mitsubishi Triton MR
 - This repository is a backup of the firmware files and patches from Vhedia, in case the originals are taken offline
 - This repository also holds instructions for setup and fixes I have applied to the unit
 - The original source of these of these files is [vhedia.com.au/download-m-series-update](https://vhedia.com.au/download-m-series-update/)

## Setup instructions

 - I like the Android skin with just a speedo on the home screen, not a map, as I want to do 100% of my map use from within Carplay and iOS.  The last firmware with this homescreen, is the build from Sep-2024, a copy of which is held in this repository.
 - Note that "latest stable Android _(sic)_", that the (sales pitch suggests is available here)[https://vhedia.com.au/product/mitsubishi-triton-mq-mr-head-unit-2016-2021-dail-aircon/] is **NOT** available for Vhedia M-series head unit (material mis-selling that I was misled by), only Android 10 (at least from Vhedia, my vendor in Australia), and this Sep-2024 version has all the final Android 10 security patches included, there is not a lot to be gained by keeping pace with Vhedia's later firmware updates.
 - However the Vhedia M-series head unit is simply the Junsun 8667Q (8GB RAM, 128GB internal storage), with a custom Vhedia firmware - you could try other Junsun firmware, but your mileage may vary (and the maintainer of this backup repository has no interest in any further exploration of these possibilities).
